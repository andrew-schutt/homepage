<p width="800">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my name is Andrew Schutt, I am a technology professional in central Iowa.  This is my personal website for me to use as a place to experiment, post and put up whatever.  In 2011 graduated with a degree in <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/">Computer Science</a> and a minor in <a href="http://www.cba.uni.edu/">General Business</a> from the <a href="http://www.uni.edu">University of Northern Iowa</a>. <a href="images/Photo83.jpg">Here</a> is a recent picture of me just kicking it with my cat Beaker.  I am an avid music listener and soccer fan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently read about some folks that did X websites in X days (such as 180 websites in 180 days) as a means to learn more about web development.  <a href="100websites.html">Here</a> is my attempt at this feat for my own good to learn more about web development.  I wish to learn about everything that goes along with being a web developer such as CSS, Javascript, Angular, Ruby (well Rails), and PostgreSQL are where I will start.  The plan is to use GitHub to manage this, which, means I will delve into that tool further as well.

For reference these are the sites that I pull my inspiration from
