<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously the 'About Me' page.  Welcome and remember if you have any questions feel free to contact me.
<hr noshade>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my home page stated I'm was at the University of Northern Iowa.  I have enjoyed all of my time back in Cedar Falls, but I now have my degree in hand.  In school I held a job performing tech support and basic sys admin work for multiple departments under the University Vice President office.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of work I enjoy many different hobbies.  Fiddling with computers and generally 
fixing/breaking computers/software/consoles is a past time of mine.
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always loved the game of soccer and have been playing since I was a little toddler running around following 
my older brother.
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening and sifting through music is something I greatly enjoy as well.  Take a look through my Last.fm profile and see if we share any similar tastes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hobby of mine is simply sitting down and writing scripts and various, essentially, meaningless programs to complete trivial and especially repetitive tasks.  Being presented with a problem and finding a solution is why I enjoy programming.  I also am working through the 100 websites in 100 days.  Check out my progress <a href="100websites.html">here</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other hobby and passion is reading.  For leisure I will 
read books, novels,  magazines, newspapers, online articles, Wikipedia, and, well, essentially anything that I can get my hands on (or finger-tips for that matter) I am currently reading
