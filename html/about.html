<p>  This is obviously the 'About Me' page.  Welcome and remember if you have any questions feel free to contact me.
<br /><br />
As my home page stated I'm currently at the University of Northern Iowa.  I have enjoyed all of my time here in Cedar Falls, but look forward to the day that I will have my degree in hand striding forward into the world.  I am now in the stressful and tedious process of finding a career.  So if you need a fresh college graduate with a IT background I am your man!  
<br /><br />
I enjoy many different hobbies.  Fiddling with computers and generally 
fixing/breaking computers/software/consoles is a past time of mine.<br /><br />
  I have always loved the game of soccer and have been playing since I was a little toddler running around following 
my older brother.<br /><br />
  As I have gotten older I have a greater appreciation of music.  Often in my free time I will attempt to discover new musical artists.  Take a look through my Last.fm profile and see if we share any similar tastes.<br /><br />
  Another hobby of mine is simply sitting down and writing silly scripts and various, essentially, meaningless programs to complete trival and especially repeative tasks.  Being presented with a problem and finding a solution is why I enjoy programming.<br /><br />
    My other hobby and passion is reading.  For leisure I will 
read books, novels,  magazines, newspapers, online articles, Wikipedia, and, well, essentially anything that I can get my hands on (or finger-tips for that matter) I am currently reading
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siddhartha_(novel)" >Siddhartha</a> by Hermann Hesse
<br /><br />
I also have a few nephews (four to be exact) that I adore and enjoy watching them grow up and learn from my sisters.  I really owe my parents more then I can say and  I of course miss my cat and dogs from back home!</p>
